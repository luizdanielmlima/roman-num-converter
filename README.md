# roman number converter

Very simple app that converts numbers to roman numerals. One of my first "projects" in JS/HTML/CSS, derived from an algorithm excercise from freecodecamp.org.

## Some Observations

- At the time I used some very basic Jquery, just to learn a bit of it.
- I tried to make the UI interesting, with some graphic elements related to the theme. It was nice to use CSS flexbox to get the layout I wanted.
- In the end itÂ´s very simple, quite a begginer project, but it made me learn some good stuff ;-)

Best regards,
